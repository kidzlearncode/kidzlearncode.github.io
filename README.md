Browser tool teach kids how to code! Features a character Shellby who moves in a grid space and can do things like eat leafs distributed on the grid. Shellby is controlled by a Lua script. Lua was chosen because it does not require a lot of symbols that childen who havent had typing classes may not know how to type on the keyboard, instead the instructor can just use words and tell the kids how to type symbols in the instances where they are required beforehand. I would like to add the option to use C++ and javascript in the future. Its a very simple tool without a lot of complex setup or unnecessary trinkets on the website allowing for ease of use and focus. Currently kids can achieve goals and go through a set of hard coded levels. I plan to add the ability to save code as well as have different exercises in the future and allow teacher access to the kids accounts.
