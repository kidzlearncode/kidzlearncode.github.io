Browser tool teach kids how to code! Features a character Shellby who moves in a grid space and can do things like eat leafs distributed on the grid. Shellby is controlled by a lua script. Lua was chosen because it does not require a lot of symbols that are hard to type on the keyboard. I would like to add the option to use C++ and javascript in the future. Its a very simple tool without a lot of complex setup or unnecessary trinkets on the website allowing for ease of use and focus. Currently kids can achieve goals and go through a set of hard coded levels. I plan to add the ability to save code as well as have different exercises in the future and allow teacher access to the kids accounts.
